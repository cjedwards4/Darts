This README file explains how to use the program ?Darts?, which was created by Chris Edwards and Kenneth Howerton for CSC 204, instructed by Dr. Sarami, at Fayetteville State University, April 2017.

---Run in an IDE?

If you want to run the code in an IDE, such as Eclipse, copy the contents of the folders into the IDE and run it.  Note: Only copy the Darts.java and DartsPlayer.java specifically to run.  

---Run from the .jar file---

Simply double click on the icon and the game will run automatically. 

---Gameplay---

The first box to pop up is for players to enter their names.   Enter names, click submit.  Move the mouse cursor to the spot you want to throw your dart and click.  

Each player gets three turns before it moves to the next player.  Follow the statement at the bottom of the screen that will display if it is the next player?s turn.  Each player will have three sets of three turns and then a final throw for each player before the game is over.  

---Scoring---

Each throw will add the corresponding value to the player?s score. Highest score wins. 

Outside of the dartboard, and on the outer black ring will result in zero points if a dart lands there unless it is on the moving shape which is discussed in extra points below. 

Double: The red and green fields furthest from the center of the dartboard give 2 times the points of the corresponding number in the outer ring.  

Triple: The red and green fields between the Doubles and the center of the dartboard give 3 times the points of the corresponding number in the outer ring.  

Single: The white and black fields enclosed by the red and green fields give points based on the value of the corresponding number in the outer ring. 

Extra points: Each of the moving shapes provides extra points based on the corresponding value located in the upper left hand corner of the scoreboard. 


---Restart/Quit---

In order to restart the game, click the ?Restart? button in the lower right hand corner and re-enter player names.  

To quit, simply exit out of the window or click the ?Quit? button located next to the ?Restart? button.
